# AFI Hub Landing Page Setup

## Files Created

## Required Images to Copy
You need to copy these images from the original spothublandingpage.webflow/images folder:

1. **Background image**: `login-bkgd-slategray-crop.jpg`
2. **Favicon**: `favicon.ico` 
3. **Webclip**: `webclip.png`
4. **Logo files** (all AshleyHub_Logo files) - these are placeholders until you have the AFI Hub logo

## Changes Made
- Updated title to "AFI Hub Landing Page"
- Updated registration URL to: `https://core.spothub.com/account/register/afihub`
- Updated support email subject to "AFI Hub Login Help"
